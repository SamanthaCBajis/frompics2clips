<br /> This repository contains a Unity mobile application for iOS devices called **_frompics2clips_**. The application is an interactive experience where the user can engage with two real photo images that will bring fun characters to life while looking at the images through their mobile device. Simply build, print, and you have a dance party!
<br />
<br /> Please print these images (best would be paste it to a Word document and cut out)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The software you will need to download in order to build and run the game on a mobile device:
<br /> 
<br /> • The cross-platform engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-2017.2.0 "Unity 3D download") Version 2017.2.0f3.
<br />
- The latest version of [Xcode.](https://developer.apple.com/download/ "Xcode 9.3 Beta")
- NOTE! You will need to have an [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!&page=create "Developer Account") in order to download Xcode and build for iOS.
- NOTE! Make sure to have the latest software version; 11 and up.

### Installing
To build and run a copy of this application to your mobile device:
<br />
<br /> • On the **_frompics2clips_** repository, go to the green "Clone or download" button and click "Download Zip".
<br />
<br /> • Once the zip file has loaded onto your desktop, double click the zip file to open. Navigate to the folder Assets > PCscene.unity and double click the scene to open it in Unity.
<br />
<br /> -NOTE! The scene may not be located at the top of the folder. If not, you will have to scroll through the folder to find it. It will be titled exactly PCscene.unity with the Unity logo-
<br />
<br /> After opening the scene in Unity choose to build to an iOS mobile device:
<br />
1. iOS build:
   - Go to File > Build Settings and switch the platform to iOS (this can take a while) then click the Player Settings button below that and with this open you can change the name of the application and bundle identifier, if you would like to change them, before pressing Build and Run to then be prompted to name the build and save it. (I usually save the build to my desktop so I can delete it later) 
     - The build will open in Xcode. Make sure to check your Apple ID is correct, the bundle identifier and the name of the application is what you would like it to be then press the play button in the upper left corner and the application will build and run directly to your iOS device.

### Deployment
When building the application to your phone an important note:
<br />
<br /> • In Player Settings, you are able to not only change the name of the application and bundle identifier to whatever you would like you can also add a photo to be the icon for the application on your phone! It will be one of the first things you can do in Player Settings. Right under renaming the application.

<br /> • After printing the images above and opening the application on your mobile device, hold the devices camera towards the printed photos. 
<br />
<br /> • The characters will start to move as the camera focuses on the images. Feel free to place the camera over one or both of the images at the same time. The cartoons can dance together or perform a solo for you!
<br />
<br /> • NOTE! The tracking only works with the images in the line of the camera. Please don't shake the device or get too close to the images. Simply look for a better angle to get them to appear on your device.
